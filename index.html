                <q>We may be comfortably living in our apartments or houses. We may not be getting affected by hunger
                    during this time of despair. But there are so many people out there who may not have eaten a proper
                    meal
                    in the last few days. We are all in this together. We all can do our bit.Let's
                    feed the hungry and help the less fortunate among us. Together we can make this situation a better
                    place.</q>

            <p class="text">The first advantage of providing direct support is that you can know exactly how your money
                is being
                spent.For example, if you give money directly to people in your local village or town, you can see
                where it has gone. When you donate to larger charitable organisations, on the other hand, you are not
                sure how much will actually be given to those in need as opposed going on other costs such as
                administration.</p>

                <h3>Food for a family
                </h3>
                <p>Our programmes go beyond traditional aid models to beat hunger in innovative ways. Increasingly, we
                    send cash directly to hungry families because they’re the ones who know best how to end their hunger
                    for good.</p>

                <p> Shelter for a family is the most needy for addressing family homelessness, providing homelessness
                    prevention, emergency shelter, workforce development, education, financial capability, health and
                    wellness, and so much more.</p>

                <p>Education develops critical thinking. This is vital in teaching a child how to use logic when making
                    decisions and interacting with people (e.g., boosting creativity, enhancing time management). It
                    helps a child to growup with the better destiny.
